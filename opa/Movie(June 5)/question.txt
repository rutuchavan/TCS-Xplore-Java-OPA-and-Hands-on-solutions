Create a class Movie with the below attributes:
    movieId – int
    director – String
    rating – int
    budget – int
Write getters, setters and paramerized constructors in the above mentioned attribute sequence as required.
Create class Solution with the main method. Implement two static methods-
findAvgBudgetByDirector and getMovieByRatingBudget in Solution class.

findAvgBudgetByDirector method:
This method will take two input parameters-array of Movie objects and string parameter director. The method will return the average of the budget attribute from Movie objects directed by the director passed as parameter. If no movie with the given director is present in the array of movie objects, then the method should return 0.

getMovieByRatingBudget method:
This method will take two int parameters rating and budget, along with the array of movie objects. The method will return the movie object, if the input parameters rating and budget, matches with the rating and budget attribute of the movie object respectively.
Also check of rating is a factor of budget(ex: 3 is factor of 12 bcz 3 divides 12 without leaving remainder). If any of the above conditions are not met, then method should return null.

These above mentioned static methods should be called from the main method. For findAvgBudgetByDirector method – The main method should print the average budget as it is if the returned value is greater then 0, or it should print “Sorry – No movie is available with the specified rating and budget requirement”.
For getMovieByRatingBudget method – The main method should print the movieId of the returned movie object. if the returned value is null, then it should print “Sorry -No movie is available with the specified rating and budget requirement”.
